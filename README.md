# Laplace-Equation-CFD
This project implements and compares different numerical methods for solving the 2D Laplace equation, including Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, SOR, LSOR, ADI, and Fully Implicit solvers. The study focuses on accuracy, computational performance, and runtime analysis across multiple mesh sizes. Implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
